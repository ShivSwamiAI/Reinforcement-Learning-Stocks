# Reinforcement-Learning-Stocks
Applying Reinforcement learning models for stock price predictions. We are using very basic Deep Q-Learning algorithms to train our model.

## Data Used
All of the data I am using for training is publicly available on Yahoo! Finance. We will be using `Closing Prices` for our evaluation. As more complex algorithms and models are build, I will resources to those too.

## Packages used
Tensorflow is the major library that we are using to make and run our deep learning models. All of the code uses tensorflow for operation while using numpy and pandas as secondary libraries.
